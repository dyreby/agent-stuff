# Improve Agent

## Aim

Improve alignment between agent behavior and user expectations.

## Preconditions

- Read `prefs-agent` for architecture principles and taxonomy

## Procedure

1. **Clarify intent** — what should change and why
2. **Classify** — what type of content (per prefs-agent taxonomy)
3. **Locate** — which artifact should change, or create new
4. **Review** — read existing artifacts to understand context
5. **Propose** — minimal change, explain placement
6. **Apply** — make the change

## Guidelines

- Prefer durable improvements over one-off fixes
- Prefer small, local edits; keep rules composable
- Make scope explicit; justify placement
- Disambiguate before editing if wording could span multiple scopes
- Avoid duplication across skills
